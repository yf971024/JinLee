      <li><h3>Invest in good-quality sunglasses.</h3>
        <p>Too much sun exposure can damage your eyes at any time of year, even through cloud cover. Protect yourself with sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat.[1] Glass lenses are more durable, scratch-resistant, and more expensive than polycarbonate lenses, but both options offer the possibility of precise UV protection; while prices may vary between designer brands and discount stores models, what matters most is the protection level that the glasses offer.[2] Read the label and look for glasses that block 100% of both UVA and UVB rays; UV light can cause cataracts and destroy your retinas.[3]To ensure full UV protection, make sure that your sunglasses fit properly.

      <li><h3>Wear safety glasses or goggles.</h3>
        <p>When doing anything that may result in you getting particles, fumes, or debris in your eyes, be sure to wear protective glasses or goggles. Such activities could include home repairs, yardwork, woodworking, or other similar endeavors. Most eye injuries are entirely preventable, so it is worth the effort to protect your eyes from harm.

      <li><h3>Play safely.</h3>
        <p>There are reportedly over 200,000 sports-related eye injuries a year in the U.S., many of which could be prevented with proper eyewear.

        <li><h3>Avoid rubbing your eyes.</h3>
        <p> Rubbing your eyes too often can cause them damage in several ways. Since your hands carry a large number of germs, rubbing your eyes can cause the direct transfer of these germs and lead to infections like conjunctivitis. It can also exacerbate pre-existing eye conditions like progressive myopia and glaucoma. Aggressive rubbing can damage your cornea as well.[6] If your eyes itch due to allergies, rubbing them can make the reaction more severe.[7]See an eye doctor if your eyes itch often, or if they itch too much to resist rubbing. You may have allergies or another treatable condition.

      <li><h3>Get an eye exam done at least every 2 years.</h3>
        <p> As an adult, you should visit an eye doctor every couple of years to ensure good eye health. If you don't already see an eye doctor, ask your family doctor for a referral, or ask friends and family for recommendations. If you experience conditions like vision loss, pain, or irritation, make an appointment immediately; many eye conditions are treatable if addressed early. Eye doctors will test for disease and measure your visual acuity; they may give you a prescription for eyeglasses or contact lenses, or recommend corrective eye surgery depending on the condition of your eyesight.[8]

      <li><h3>Watch less TV.</h3>
        <p>Proximity to a TV screen will not cause long-term damage to your eyes, but prolonged viewing of television can still be harmful. Watching a lot of TV (more than four hours a day) can cause eye strain and fatigue, which in turn can cause blurred vision. Exposure to TV should be limited, particularly for young children.[12]

      <li><h3>Adjust your computer monitor.</h3>
        <p>It is important to protect your eyes from eye strain when at the computer, particularly if your job requires you to be looking at a computer screen for the bulk of the day. If possible, upgrade your computer screen to an LCD model, which is easier on the eyes than older models. Adjust your computer display settings to reduce eye strain â€“ adjust the brightness to match the brightness of your surrounding work area, and adjust text size to make reading more comfortable. Look up from your screen or get up from your desk as often as possible to give your eyes a break. [13]
